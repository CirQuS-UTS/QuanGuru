    "where $\\sigma_{\\pm} = (\\sigma_{x} \\pm i\\sigma_{y})/2$ are raising/lowering operators for a two-level system, $\\sigma_{\\mu}$ are the Pauli spin operators with $\\mu\\in\\{x,y,z\\}$, $a^{\\dagger}$ and $a$ are the creation and annihilation operators for the field mode, and $\\omega_{c}$, $\\omega_{q}$, and $g$ are the cavity-field, qubit, and coupling (angular-) frequencies, respectively.\n",
    "Note that the above Hamiltonian is written in a common notation where the order of the sub-system Hilbert spaces is implicitly defined by the ordering in the coupling.\n",
    "This means, for example, that the composite form of the number operator is written explicitly as $(a^{\\dagger}a)\\otimes 1_{2,2}$ (similarly, $a^{\\dagger}\\otimes\\sigma_{-}$ and $1_{d,d}\\otimes\\sigma_{z}$, where $d$ is the truncation dimension for the cavity operators and $\\otimes$ is the tensor product).\n",
