    "In both of these cases, the parameter that needs to be changed is just the value of an attribute in some other object/s.\n",

    "`updateBase` implements the first two and expects the value to be provided.\n",

    "In below examples, I will use `Qubit` objects, but `updateBase` works with any `named` and their attributes.\n",
    "Actually, NOTE THAT `updateBase` works only with `named` objects or the `_auxiliaryClass`.\n",
    "This is a deliberate design choice, and it specifically looks for the type of the given object/s and rejects other types of object. Without this type restriction, the functionality of `updateBase` would work for any object and its attribute, but it could create undefined behaviors for the sweeps.\n",
    "Still, there are ways to go around of this restriction, in case it might be needed for advanced users.\n",
